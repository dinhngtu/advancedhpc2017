\section{Implementation}

The program runs the kernel on every pixel of the image. Each thread looks for the pixels around it to perform the convolution with the Gaussian kernel:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
if (row >= height || col >= width) {
    return;
}
long i = row * width + col; // position in image pixel stream
unsigned char kernel[7][7] = { // [r][c]
    { 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0 },
    { 0, 3, 13, 22, 13, 3, 0 },
    { 1, 13, 59, 97, 59, 13, 1 },
    { 2, 22, 97, 159, 97, 22, 2 },
    { 1, 13, 59, 97, 59, 13, 1 },
    { 0, 3, 13, 22, 13, 3, 0 },
    { 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0 },
};
long sum = 0;
long acc = 0; // sum accumulator
for (int v = 0; v < 7; v++) { // r
    for (int u = 0; u < 7; u++) { // c
        int p = col + u - 3;
        int q = row + v - 3;
        if (p < 0 || p >= width || q < 0 || q >= height) {
        } else {
            long j = q * width + p;
            int gray = ((int)input[j].x + input[j].y + input[j].z) / 3;
            acc += gray * kernel[v][u];
            sum += kernel[v][u];
        }
    }
}
output[i].x = output[i].y = output[i].z = (unsigned char)(acc / sum);
\end{lstlisting}

Shared memory is implemented by declaring a shared memory section, then initializing it in the first thread of a block:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
__shared__ int CKERNEL[7][7];
__global__ void labwork5sm(uchar3 * __restrict__ input, uchar3 * __restrict__ output, long pixelCount, int width, int height) {
    if (threadIdx.x == 0 && threadIdx.y == 0) {
        int kernel[7][7] = {
            { 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0 },
            { 0, 3, 13, 22, 13, 3, 0 },
            { 1, 13, 59, 97, 59, 13, 1 },
            { 2, 22, 97, 159, 97, 22, 2 },
            { 1, 13, 59, 97, 59, 13, 1 },
            { 0, 3, 13, 22, 13, 3, 0 },
            { 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0 },
        };
        for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
                CKERNEL[j][i] = kernel[j][i];
            }
        }
    }
    __syncthreads();
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Speedup}

The speedup is as follows:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Speedup with CUDA}
    \includegraphics{pics/lw5.png}
\end{figure}

The CPU implementation has a constant speed until a blocksize of 32, which significantly reduces the program run time.
As a result, the CUDA program gains more and more speedup until a blocksize of 16, but becomes insignificantly faster at 32.
At blocksize 64, the GPU implementation again speeds up significantly, giving 31x-41x speedup over the CPU implementation at the same blocksize.
Overall, at the best configurations for each implementation, GPU gives a 17x-23x acceleration over CPU.
